# Final-Project
Fighting game 

Jump mechanics - return a var as null after two jumps. 

Hitting -  after being hit increase distance or x value of the hit on the player and y value a little | Using blocks prefab and breaking for or hitting actions. 

Moving - Using paddle but instead of mouse movement using arrows and WASD.  

Special attacks - 1st person has a jump extension, adding to the tolerance of the jump spam prevention. 2nd person has a projectile, that cannot be spammed because of delay between.

Particles - using VFX from James or block breaker video

Sound FX - Hitting, background music, jumping, specials, attack sounds like for projectiles
